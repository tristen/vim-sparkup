Sparkup for Vim
==============
Just the vim version of [Sparkup](https://github.com/rstacruz/sparkup) tailored for easy installation with pathogen.

Deprecation Warning
-------------------
The main Sparkup repository now includes easy [installation
instructions](https://github.com/rstacruz/sparkup/tree/master/vim) for pathogen
and Vundle-style plugin managers.

Due to this, there is no longer any reason to maintain this repository. It will
remain here for legacy users, but in order to receive updates, users should
uninstall this and install the main Sparkup repository instead.

Installation
------------
Like [@tpope](http://github.com/tpope) says:

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend
installing [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), and
then simply copy and paste:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/tristen/vim-sparkup.git

Once help tags have been generated, you can view the manual with
`:help sparkup`.
